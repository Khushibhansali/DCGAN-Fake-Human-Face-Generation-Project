**DCGAN Fake Human Face Generation Project**

In Face Generation project, we defined and trained a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) two part model on a dataset of faces. The main objective of our model was to generate new images of fake human faces that look as realistic as possible. We used the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) which is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200K celebrity images. The Attribute Data Noise is the input to the Generator and GAN Models. It is a random list of 40 elements (1s and 0s) with a float value between 0-1 at the end. This corresponds to the true/false attribute data that comes with the CelebA dataset with a random float value tacked on for noise. The Generator Model uses the Attribute Data Noise as input into a Deep Convolutional Network that starts with a small image and upscales it through each grouping of layers. In the end it creates a batch of rgb images designed to trick the Discriminator Model into thinking itâ€™s a face. The Discriminator model is trained half with real images from the CelebA dataset and half with fake images generated by Generator Model to output a single value on a scale of 0-1 for each image that represents whether the Model thinks the image contains a face (a value closer to 0) or no face (a value closer to 1). Finally, the complete GAN model is trained so that the generator can train to defeat the discriminator. Through the Attribute Data Noise and fake truth values, Generator Model tricks the Discriminator Model thus producing a trained GAN model. In summary, the training process comprised of defining the loss functions, selecting optimizer, and finally training the model, to generate fake human faces.
This project significantly enhanced my career competencies by equipping me with invaluable knowledge of Git workflow and proficiency in developing machine learning models in Python, leveraging deep learning frameworks such as Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Additionally, this endeavor facilitated the refinement of my communication skills, thereby fortifying my ability to effectively collaborate and communicate within professional environments.
